Trillion Code Blog App.

Created for an interview assignment for trillion code blog.
Tech stack consists of :

1. Vue
2. Pinia
3. NestJs
4. Prisma
5. MySQL
6. Docker and Docker-Compose

In order to run it locally do the following:

1. git clone the repo
2. docker-compose up --build

At this stage everything is running but the DB is unmigrated and empty therefore

3. cd in the trillion-code-blog-api and run npm install with Node 16.17.1 (latest LTS).

4. In the trillion-code-blog-api and run this command " dotenv --file .env.development run npx prisma migrate dev "

Now the db is setup but still empty.

You can now seed the db manually using the backend server rest api in this URL:

- http://localhost:3000/swagger

OR

5. run this command inside the trillion-code-blog-api folder to seed the db automatically " dotenv --file .env.development run npx prisma db seed "

Now in the following URL : - http://localhost:8080 the project is up and running with data.
